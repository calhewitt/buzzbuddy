This book, which surveys the work of thinkers like Samuel Ramos and Jorge Costa, claims that its title concept “is the profoundest fact of the human condition” because “Man is the only being who knows he is alone.” Sections titled for “The Sons of La Malinche” and “Mexican Masks” appear in—for 10 points—what book by Octavio Paz?",

David Mech and Durward Allen have published popular books about these animals living in Minong.

These animals may have facilitated growth of riparian species like willow trees, cottonwoods, and beavers, in a famous but</strong> (*) controversial example of a land trophic cascade. In September 2018, a second try at genetic rescue of these animals was approved, after one of them nicknamed “Old Gray Guy” massively improved the breeding stock and rebounded a population in the late 90s after swimming across Lake Superior.

Edward Vockell argued that these places have a drastic negative impact via the “minus-two sigma problem,” an inversion of the earlier “two-sigma problem.” In a 1965 study, Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson purported to measure “Inflected Acquisition” in these places. Elliot (*)</strong> Aronson proposed dividing these locations into “jigsaw”-like small groups. Randomly describing some people in these places as “spurters” induced the first experimental attestation of the Pygmalion effect. Workers in these often use Bloom’s taxonomy to shape goals like “analyzing” and “evaluating.” The “flipped” variety of these places has been advocated by Salman Khan.

For non-OLS linear models, this value is effectively the trace of the identity minus the hat matrix. Specifying a model term as a random effect reduces this quantity by less than if it were a fixed effect. When variances are unequal, this quantity is estimated as a weighted harmonic mean of it for each variable in Satterthwaite’s approximation. This value is the rank of the (*) residuals when calculating a test statistic. An F distribution is a ratio of two chi-squares normalized by this quantity. When estimating k parameters from n samples in OLS, this value for residuals equals n minus k. A t-distribution becomes ­normal as this parameter goes to infinity.

For non-OLS linear models, this value is effectively the trace of the identity minus the hat matrix. Specifying a model term as a random effect reduces this quantity by less than if it were a fixed effect. When variances are unequal, this quantity is estimated as a weighted harmonic mean of it for each variable in Satterthwaite’s approximation. This value is the rank of the (*)</strong> residuals when calculating a test statistic. An F distribution is a ratio of two chi-squares normalized by this quantity. When estimating <em>k</em> parameters from <em>n</em> samples in OLS, this value for residuals equals <em>n</em> minus <em>k</em>. A <em>t</em>-distribution becomes ­normal as this parameter goes to infinity. For 10 points, what term describes the number of values in a distribution that can vary?",

Four of these figures are the only figures in the top half of Raphael’s (*)</strong> <em>Triumph of Galatea</em>. These figures form a “cloud” behind a green curtain in Raphael’s <em>Sistine Madonna</em>, in which two bored-looking ones lean their elbows on the bottom of the frame. A swarm of these figures fills Peter Paul Rubens’s <em>The Feast of Venus</em>. Renaissance painters often depicted—for 10 points—what chubby baby boys?",

Punning on the Yiddish phrase for “itinerancy,” a beggar in black does this action in a work titled for the artist’s hometown of (*)</strong> Vitebsk. A pink church and green houses appear in a painting where the artist holds hands with his wife Bella, who performs this action. In another work, Bella wears black and holds flowers while the artist contorts his neck to kiss her while doing this action. For 10 points, name this action performed by Marc Chagall in his paintings <em>The Birthday</em> and <em>Over The Town</em>.",

This work of Insular Art may have derived from the same source as a similar item from Durrow, and it contains only one carpet page, unlike the contemporaneous Lindisfarne Gospels. For 10 points, name this early Medieval manuscript from a namesake Irish monastery.",

A mock Latin epic likely written by Nivardus is named for the archrival of this character, who lived with his wife Hermeline in a castle full of labyrinthine passageways known as Maleperduis. William Caxton translated an account of this figure that opens with the levying of accusations against him at a lion king’s court. This character’s enemies included Bruin the Bear and Tybert the Cat. This animal admitted to killing the daughter of the rooster Chanticleer, and was accused by Isengrim the Wolf of dishonoring his wife.

One account of this figure’s birth states that his mother, Andeng (ahn-dung), lay with a dragon, which is why he is sometimes shown with the head of a dragon but the face of a man. This figure made an accidental discovery when a bush caught on fire and the wind blew leaves and twigs into a tripod cauldron. This figured died from consuming a poisonous yellow weed and failing to take a tea antidote in time. This mythical figure is the traditional author of <em>The Classic of Herbal Medicine</em>, which was likely compiled in the 2nd century AD. This figure’s common name means “god-peasant.” He taught such skills as acupuncture and using fire to clear fields in his role as the second of the Three Sovereigns, along with Fuxi (foo-shee) and the Yellow Emperor. For 10 points, name this Chinese agriculture deity who was also known as the “God of Five Cereals.”",

        "text": "Zenithal bistable devices rely on patterning these materials. The free-energy density in these materials can be approximated by expanding to second order in the curvature strains and collecting the terms into “bend,” “splay,” and “twist” terms, which yields the Oseen-Frank expression for that free energy. A parameter that characterizes these materials is typically computed as the average of the second Legendre polynomial of cosine theta, where theta is the angle between the director and the molecular axis.

The free-energy density in these materials can be approximated by expanding to second order in the curvature strains and collecting the terms into “bend,” “splay,” and “twist” terms, which yields the Oseen-Frank expression for that free energy. A parameter that characterizes these materials is typically computed as the average of the second Legendre polynomial of cosine theta, where theta is the angle between the director and the molecular axis.

A metaphor in this novel’s first chapter compares the tailcoats of men at a ball to flies fluttering around a block of sugar cut by an old housekeeper. During Dimitri’s trial in The Brothers Karamazov, the lawyer Kirillovich questions the optimism of a passage from this novel in which the narrator asks “who invented thee!” of a “bird-like” object. In a study of this novel’s author that examines those passages, Vladimir Nabokov argued that this novel’s characters exude a type of vulgarity called “poshlust.” In the last paragraph of this novel, the narrator imagines how “nations and states gaze askance as they step aside and give her the right away” in an extended metaphor comparing Russia to a three-horse sleigh, or troika.

        "formatted_text": "A critic claimed that this novel shocked its readers as Édouard Manet did “the bewhiskered philistines of his day” with its lengthy description of an overgrown garden shaded by aspen trees. A metaphor in this novel’s first chapter compares the tailcoats of men at a ball to flies fluttering around a block of sugar cut by an old housekeeper. During Dimitri’s trial in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, the lawyer Kirillovich questions the optimism of a passage from this novel in which the narrator asks “who invented thee!” of a “bird-like” object. In a study of this novel’s author that examines those passages, Vladimir Nabokov argued that this novel’s characters exude a type of vulgarity called “poshlust.” In the last paragraph of this novel, the narrator imagines how “nations and states gaze askance as they step aside and give her the right away” in an extended metaphor comparing Russia to a three-horse sleigh, or <em>troika</em>. For 10 points, name this novel about the conman Chichikov by Nikolai Gogol.",

Franklin Fisher criticized the stringent assumptions necessary for the “micro” version of these mathematical entities to aggregate to a “macro” one. The translog example of these objects is commonly used in estimation because it is linear in parameters and is an approximation of the CES type. A 2014 paper by Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman estimates one of their parameters to be about 1.25 and uses that fact to link falling investment prices to the declining labor share.

Franklin Fisher criticized the stringent assumptions necessary for the “micro” version of these mathematical entities to aggregate to a “macro” one. The translog example of these objects is commonly used in estimation because it is linear in parameters and is an approximation of the CES type. A 2014 paper by Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman estimates one of their parameters to be about 1.25 and uses that fact to link falling investment prices to the declining labor share.

        "formatted_text": "This author included an unconventional list of props including “smell effects: incense . . . dirt/filth smells/bodies” at the beginning of a play subtitled “A Historical Pageant.” In a play by this author, a woman says “you look like you've been reading Chinese poetry and drinking lukewarm sugarless tea; you look like death eating a soda cracker,” prompting the protagonist to wonder if she knows Warren Enright. A play by this author ends with the revolutionary Walker Vessels being injured by an explosion that is implied to have killed the two “freakish mulatto” daughters he had with his ex-wife Grace. A character who enters the stage eating an apple enrages the protagonist by calling him “Uncle Thomas Woolly-Head” before stabbing him in a play by this author about Lulu and Clay’s conversation on a New York City subway car. For 10 points, name this African-American author of the plays <em>The Slave Ship</em>, <em>The Slave</em>, and <em>Dutchman</em>.",

During that conflict between these groups, the Lachin Corridor became a vital supply line that one side dubbed the “Road of Peace.” Mirza Khazar provided the only daily accounts of a crackdown on one of these ethnic groups by broadcasting on Radio Free Liberty. A conflict between these groups was partly sparked by a pogrom in Sumgait, and a state of emergency dubbed “Black January” was intended to prevent one of these sides from fighting the other. One of these two groups committed the Khojaly (koh-JAH-lee) massacre against civilians of the other side, and shelled that sides newly created capital of Stepanakert. The OSCE Minsk group tries to resolve disputes between these two groups, which agreed to a ceasefire in the Bishkek Protocol. For 10 points, name these two ethnicities whose countries fought over control of the region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the 1990s.",

        "formatted_text": "C. K. Williams reported that a polymerization using one of these compounds as a starting material had excellent control through use of a particular zinc (II) diamine complex. A seco acid is slowly added to a solution with TFBA or MNBA to form one of these compounds in a reaction named for Isamu Shiina (shee-ee-nah). These compounds name a class of psychoactive molecules, such as kavain, that are derived from the kava root. The presence of a gamma-lactam and one of these structures defines the core of a sa·lin·o·spor·amide. Bougault discovered a reaction in which an oxygen and iodine are added across a double bond to form one of these compounds. Pharmaceuticals containing this functional group end with the suffix -romycin (roh-MICE-in) and are polyketides called macrolides. A six-carbon molecule of this type is polymerized to form PLA and forms from the dimerization and dehydration of lactic acid. For 10 points, name these compounds that consist of cyclic esters.",

Ann Ferguson criticized the role of public elementary schools in defining this quality in black people. In an ethnography of “River High,” C. J. Pascoe argued that this quality is constituted in contrast to the “specter” of an “abject position.” According to a 2015 book by Philip Zimbardo and Nikita Coulombe, digital technology is driving a “crisis” in this quality. This quality is the subject of Jennifer Siebel Newsom’s documentary <em>The Mask You Live In.</em> Raewyn Connell argued that there are multiple types of this quality, rather than the singular, “hegemonic” variant romanticized in the Carl Jung-influenced writing of Robert Bly. Michael Kimmel studies regressive behavior driven by excesses of this quality, which psychologists sometimes call “toxic.” For 10 points, name this gendered set of behaviors constructed in opposition to femininity.",

The first oncovirus, which was discovered by studying this organism, has a mechanism later shown to be caused by the Src (“sarc”) gene. The bursa of Fabricius was discovered to produce antibodies in this model organism. For 10 points, <em>Gallus gallus</em> is the scientific name of which domesticated bird?",

        "formatted_text": "Uhm and Beloborodov developed a mechanical model to explain observations of these phenomena in terms of forward and reverse shocks. The achromatic breaks in the light curves of these phenomena provide evidence for strong collimation. These phenomena are divided into prompt emission and afterglow phases. The 1992 BATSE experiment resulted in a catalog of over 300 of these phenomena. The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is designed to detect these phenomena and was previously named for them. These events were first observed by the Vela satellites, which had originally been designed to detect terrestrial nuclear detonations. Unlike a similar class of events dubbed “soft repeaters,” these events are believed to result from jets formed in massive supernovas, or “hypernovas.” For 10 points, name these short astronomical events that are named for the extremely energetic photons that they release.",

A detective named Catherine tries to stop a series of suicide bombings by children who recite this poet in the story “The Children’s Crusade.” This poet’s work forms a motif in the stories that form Michael Cunningham’s novel Specimen Days. A poem by this man is set at a time when “the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,” and describes “two feather’d guests from Alabama.” This poet wrote of people singing “what belongs to him or her and to none else, / the day what belongs to the day” in a poem about the “varied carols” he heard in the title place. The phrase “the sea whisper’d me” ends a poem by this man about “the low and delicious word death” and “the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle.” For 10 points, name this poet of “I Hear America Singing” and “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,” which appear in his book Leaves of Grass.",

        "formatted_text": "This book’s pragmatic view of skepticism is presented in a passage arguing that “Nature confounds the Pyrrhonists, and reason confounds the dogmatists.” Edward McClennen popularized the use of a decision matrix to formalize an argument that this book details under the heading “<em>Infinite-nothing</em>.” This book points out that “it is not necessary that the entire universe arm itself to crush” man because a drop of water can kill him in a passage comparing man to a “thinking reed.” This book sums up its distinction between the two complementary faculties of the mathematical mind and the intuitive mind with the aphorism “the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.” This book claims that the whole face of the world would be different if Cleopatra’s nose had been shorter and contains an argument beginning “God is, or He is not. But to which side shall we incline?” For 10 points, name this fragmentary book of thoughts that contains the “wager” of its author, Blaise Pascal.",

        "formatted_text": "This substance can form a structure whose AB form is called the Bernal stack. The Staudenmaier, Hofmann, and Hummers methods are used to produce a precursor to this substance. This substance has a more intense and slightly downshifted G’ band compared to a similar substance. After producing this substance with CVD it is commonly functionalized with a protective PMMA layer which is used in order to transfer this substance. A tin compound with the structure of this compound has drawn interest as as potential topological insulator. The ability of this compound to form multiple hexahapto-metal complexes may have potential as an optical lattice. Potassium sandwiched between equivalents of this compound forms a strong intercalated reducing agent called KC8. In spite of the difficulty found in synthesizing this substance via epitaxy, it can be isolated using just scotch tape. For 10 points name this 2D carbon allotrope consisting of a hexagonal lattice.",

This condition can be characterized by the presence of compounds prefixed proto-, uro-, and copro- in the urine and feces. Gunther disease is a form of this condition caused by mutations in <em>UROS</em>, and this condition may also be caused by mutations in <em>HMBS</em> and <em>PPOX</em>. A 10% glucose infusion can be used to treat acute varieties of this condition. Ferrochelatase defects cause a form of this condition called EPP. This condition is either “erythropoietic” or “hepatic” depending on where a certain set of compounds builds up. A urine sample from an acute bout of this condition will change to a reddish-purple color after time in the sun. For 10 points, name this set of conditions that occurs due to faulty heme metabolism and that is named for the tetrapyrrole found in heme.",

This investigation uncovered that some 40 million dollars in illicit money was being hidden in a shell company called Jesus.com and that the world’s largest meat company, JBS, had paid some 185 million dollars in bribes. This investigation originally focused on <em>doleiros</em> but has expanded to include a former president whose lawyers claim he is too old to have to answer to charges. As a result of this scandal, thousands of layoffs have hit employees of the oil company Petrobras. For 10 points, identify this “operation” that has uncovered massive money laundering in Brazil and that is named for the fact that a service station was used to move illicit payments.",

        "text": "A paper on these data structures by Douglas Comer suggests that they could be used for a virtual paging system due to the ease of writing a “Least Recently Used” algorithm for them. That paper also contains an overview of IBM’s VSAM, an early system that used these data structures. As usually implemented, these data structures always guarantee an occupancy of at least 50%, making them very space efficient. The prefix-key compression algorithm is needed when implementing these data structures to guarantee their high fanout.

That paper also contains an overview of IBM’s VSAM, an early system that used these data structures. As usually implemented, these data structures always guarantee an occupancy of at least 50%, making them very space efficient. The prefix-key compression algorithm is needed when implementing these data structures to guarantee their high fanout.

The Kolmogorov zero-one law states that any event belonging to the “tail” one of these objects must have probability zero or one. Constantin Carathéodory (KA-ra-tay-oh-do-ree) demonstrated that a measure on a ring of subsets can be extended to one of these objects generated by that ring.

        "formatted_text": "A garrison of troops stationed on an island in this body of water inducted the first black Freemasons, led by Prince Hall, into the order. In response to military action in this body of water, sympathetic legislators led by Robert Carter Nicholas introduced a bill proposing a “Day of Fasting” to be held on June 1. Islands within this body of water were used to detain natives forcibly removed from “praying towns” such as Natick and some inhabitants of the Dedham Grant. A large amount of “Bohea” ended up in this body of water in an event whose planners met in the Green Dragon Tavern. An anonymous play titled <em>The Blockheads</em> was written, possibly by Mercy Otis Warren, after this body of water was blockaded under the terms of the Port Act, which was passed by Lord North’s government along with the other Intolerable Acts. For 10 points, name this body of water where, on December 16, 1773, the Sons of Liberty held a so-called “Tea Party.”",

        "formatted_text": "An essay argues that literature in this language has been judged “stripped of its style,” leaving its writers “like men deprived [of their clothes] by an earthquake or a railway accident.” A translator of works in this language nicknamed “Kot” had an unrequited crush on his collaborator Katherine Mansfield and a rivalry with an author whose son David wrote <em>Lady into Fox</em> while part of the Bloomsbury Group. A story in this language lays emphasis “upon such unexpected places that at first it seems as if there were no emphasis at all” according to an essay that disfavorably compares <em>Ulysses</em> with that story about a dying soldier on a ship. Virginia Woolf’s “Modern Fiction” discusses literature of this language, which Woolf knew through a translator often criticized for skipping or smoothing out difficult passages. British modernism was influenced by translations from this language that Constance Garnett released in the 1910s, such as <em>The Darling and Other Stories</em>. For 10 points, name this language used by Anton Chekhov.",

A scholar’s assertion that performing these practices “is work!” partially inspired a landmark text in the study of these entities, which argues that they serve to align or integrate thought and action and was titled repetitively by Catherine Bell for their “theory” and their “practice.” Erving Goffman’s essay “On Face-work” was published in a collection of essays titled for the “interaction” type of these practices. A chapter on the “paradoxes of twinship” appears in a book about “structure and anti-structure” in these practices.

        "formatted_text": "A type of these practices “of rebellion” was identified by South African anthropologist Max Gluckman in a book titled for them “in South-East Africa.” Jane Ellen Harrison, F. M. Cornford, and A. B. Cook were part of a group of classicists named for studying these practices at Cambridge. A scholar’s assertion that performing these practices “is <em>work</em>!” partially inspired a landmark text in the study of these entities, which argues that they serve to align or integrate thought and action and was titled repetitively by Catherine Bell for their “theory” and their “practice.” Erving Goffman’s essay “On Face-work” was published in a collection of essays titled for the “interaction” type of these practices. A chapter on the “paradoxes of twinship” appears in a book about “structure and anti-structure” in these practices. Victor Turner wrote about the “process” of, for 10 points, what class of social practices characterized by ordered performance, such as the Hindu puja and the Catholic Mass?",

Artists in another visual medium created the subtle illusion of this kind of shape by using the technique of “ponderation.” The theory of aesthetics in the book The Analysis of Beauty is based on William Hogarth’s theory that the eye naturally followed a “line of beauty” of this shape. Following Praxiteles, ancient sculptors based the contrapposto form on, for 10 points, what shape of line, also called a “serpentine curve”?",

        "formatted_text": "This thinker’s major work is treated as “political anthropology” in an Etienne Balibar book titled for him “and Politics.” This “subversive” philosopher is the subject of <em>The Savage Anomaly</em> by an author who used one of his terms to title a book about the “monstrosity” of the “living social flesh.” This thinker is placed between Duns Scotus and Nietzsche as theorizers of the univocity of being in <em>Difference and Repetition</em> by Deleuze, who called him the “prince of philosophers” and wrote <em>Expressionism in Philosophy</em> about him. He’s not Machiavelli, but Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s <em>Multitude</em> takes its title concept from a work of by this author, in which aristocracy, monarchy, and his preferred model of democracy are described as the three types of government. Judith Butler’s “The Desire to Live” treats this philosopher’s idea that a thing wants to “persevere in its being,” his <em>conatus</em> principle. For 10 points, name this thinker, the subject of the 1780s Pantheism controversy and the author of <em>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</em> and <em>Ethics</em>.",

It was built by King Calafes, also called Alphasan, as a gift for Alain le Gros and his brother after they cured the king of leprosy. A visitor to this structure, distracted by the sight of a beautiful maiden was punished with an empty plate during a magical feast. Earlier, that man had failed to save a woman from a boiling bath outside this structure’s gates. In this structure, a fiery spear was cast at anyone who used its Adventurous Bed, which Gawain survived only because he slept in his armor.

His twelfth violin sonata is a set of variations on the Portuguese dance tune “La Folia.” He placed a “Pastorale ad libitum” at the end of a piece inscribed as “fatto per la notte di natale.” For 10 points, name this Italian baroque composer whose Concerto Grosso Opus 6, No. 8, is popularly known as the “Christmas Concerto.”",

A recurring motif in its first movement consists of the left hand playing “D-flat – D-flat – D-flat – C” and echoes how this piece’s opening four-bar theme is repeated a semitone higher after its initial statement. This piece’s first movement marks the first time its composer omitted the exposition repeat in the sonata-allegro form, while the final movement goes even further by repeating only the development and recapitulation.

        "formatted_text": "In this cycle’s 31st poem, the speaker says that “a kiss is but a kiss now!” before stating that he and the addressee will sit “and eat our pot of honey on the grave.” Cecil Day-Lewis wrote an introduction for the 1948 edition of this collection and titled his memoir for its line “their hearts held cravings for the buried day.” In its 16th poem, the speaker says that a woman’s cheek was “salt against my kiss” and upsets her by saying “Ah, yes! / Love dies!” That poem from this sequence opens with the line “in our old shipwrecked days there was an hour.” In this cycle’s final poem, a husband and wife are compared to “rapid falcons in a snare, / condemned to do the flitting of the bat.” That couple is compared to sculptured effigies “wishing for the sword that severs all” in a poem from this sequence that opens “by this he knew she wept with waking eyes.” The poet’s wife, Mary Ellen, left him for Henry Wallis, which inspired, for 10 points, what 50-sonnet sequence by George Meredith about his deteriorating marriage?",
