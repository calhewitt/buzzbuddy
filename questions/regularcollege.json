The ‘particle’ type of these regions is located at a distance given by the speed of light multiplied by the conformal time since the start of the universe. An entropy named for Bekenstein is proportional to the area of one type of these regions. Hawking radiation is emitted when virtual particles pair-create near one kind of these entities that might possess a ‘firewall’. That is the ‘event’ type of these regions, which surround black holes.

A Bogoliubov [bog-ol-YOU-bov] transformation preserves the symplectic structure on these entities’ Hilbert space by mixing certain operators using hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Spontaneously broken symmetries are accompanied by the Goldstone variety of these particles. Wave functions of N particles of this type can be computed using permanents to enforce the equality of the wave function under particle exchange. At low temperatures gases of these particles form a condensate named for their namesake and Einstein. For 10 points, name these integer spin particles, one fundamental example of which is the ‘Higgs’ particle.",

        "formatted_text": "One author from an offshoot of this movement wrote the poetry collection <em>Plumb</em>; that is the Romanian George Bacovia. A poem from this movement tells of a dead poet whose ‘naked sword provokes his century’. An author from this movement wrote a sonnet that uses a difficult-to-translate word spelt ‘p-t-y-x’, while another author wrote a poem in which the narrator claims that ‘the long sobs of autumn violins wound my heart’. The author of ‘Edgar Allen Poe’s Tomb’ was associated with this movement, as was a poet who wrote that the title object is ‘as fragile as a May butterfly’ in ‘The Drunken Boat’. For 10 points, name this French literary movement whose authors included Stéphane Mallarmé ['mall-arm-AY'], Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud ['ram-BOH'].",

Broadband decoupling is used to simplify spectra in one version of this technique, but in another version this is not necessary, as the satellite peaks are small due to relative isotopic abundance. Often carried out in a deuterated solvent, for 10 points, name this technique that observes the chemical environment of nuclei with non-zero spin, such as protons and carbon-13.",

Another composer who worked in this country wrote an organ passacaglia with a four-bar seven-note ostinato, as well as a keyboard aria called ‘La Capricciosa’. Works like those inspired another composer from this modern-day country to walk 200 miles to see their composer play. Another piece from this country has three violins entering in sequence above an eight-note basso continuo that continually returns to its key of D major. For 10 points, name this country whose Baroque organists included Dietrich Buxtehude and Johann Pachelbel.",

In its original appearance, this song is sung at the end of a work set on the Isle of Athelney. Malcolm Sargent’s arrangement of this song often replaces one written by Henry Wood for the end of the <em>Fantasia on British Sea Songs</em>. From Thomas Arne’s masque <em>Alfred</em>, for 10 points, name this song which insists that ‘Britons never will be slaves.’",

This author wrote a poem in which a man says that it will only be four months until he and his wife can be together again to a figure described in Arthur Ryder’s translation as ‘a dark nipple on Earth's bosom white.’ This author wrote that poem about an exiled yaksha, a servant of the god Kubera, as well as a work in which a king falls in love with a hermit’s daughter while hunting. That woman is later rejected when presented at court, and Dushyanta only realises his mistake when a fisherman discovers a lost ring in a fish’s belly.

This non-Islam faith was the main religion denigrated by the Tang Dynasty as <em>chicai shimo</em> or ‘vegetarian devil-worshippers’, and this was also the religion of the Uighur Khaganate. This religion posits that there were five Shekhinas, or ‘Great Ones’, that assisted in the three creations of the world by the Father of Greatness. A representative of this religion’s ‘hearers’, Faustus, at first convinces, then disappoints, St. Augustine. In this religion, the non-omnipotent God takes part in the constant struggle between light and dark. For 10 points, name this dualistic religion founded by a namesake Persian prophet.",

One work argues that the transition to viewing these things as “an absolute end” in themselves, or a <em>beruf</em> (“buh-ROOF”), occurred alongside the “rationalization” of the world. Barbara Ehrenreich wrote about her experience of these things in three states in her book <em>Nickel and Dimed</em>, which detailed why Americans often need to have more than one of them.

This opera’s libretto, written by Montagu Slater, was based on George Crabbe’s poem <em>The Borough. Four Sea Interludes</em> are often excerpted from this opera. For 10 points, name this opera in which the title fisherman is accused of killing his apprentices, composed by Benjamin Britten.",

This man condemned two of his sons after they murdered all the men of Shechem in retaliation for the rape of their sister. On his deathbed, he condemned his eldest son for defiling his bed by sleeping with his concubine. In Islamic tradition, since this man’s father was a prophet, his blessing was intentional, while in Christian tradition, he had to deceive his father by wearing goatskin on his arms. This man sold some red lentil soup to his older brother Esau in exchange for his birthright. Jews refuse to eat meat from the sciatic nerve in honor of an injury that this man acquired while wrestling an angel who then gave him the name Israel.

        "formatted_text": "This playwright founded the small Intima Theater, where many of his plays were first performed. At the end of a play by this author, a young woman who complains about the drudgery of keeping the “filth of life” away disappears behind a screen as white light fills the room and a harp plays. One of this playwright’s characters is a “Sunday child,” which supposedly allows him to see people who others can’t, such as the apparition of a milkmaid. A character created by this man breaks off her engagement when her fiancé refuses to jump over a riding whip. In the same play by this author, a character is convinced to waltz with the title character and cheats on the cook Christine. In that play by this author, the valet Jean (“zhahn”) cuts off the head of the title character’s canary with a razor blade. For 10 points, name this Swedish playwright of <em>The Ghost Sonata</em> and <em>Miss Julie</em>.",

According to some Chinese legends, one type of this instrument was invented by the Yellow Emperor, though historically it was probably imported during the Han Dynasty. A hunchbacked trickster deity that plays one of these instruments delivers unborn babies to young girls in myths from the American southwest. Krishna is often portrayed in the Tribhanga posture with one of these musical instruments. The Hopi god Kokopelli is commonly depicted playing one of these instruments, which represents his giant penis. For 10 points, name this class of musical instrument invented and played by the Greek god Pan.",

The last public performance of soprano Maria Callas (“CAL-uss”) was held in 1974 in this island’s largest city. A breakaway republic on this island was established by French army officer Jules Barnet. Shakushain’s revolt was led on this island in the late 1660s against its governing Matsumae clan. The Republic of Ezo on this island, the first democracy in its country, was established in the aftermath of the Boshin War by Tokugawa officials fleeing from the Meiji Restoration. This island’s native people practice bear sacrifice in the Iyomante ritual. The Ainu people are native to, for 10 points, what northernmost Japanese island?",

This concept is likened to a man who “becomes winged” and “looks upward like a bird” when experiencing the fourth form of divine madness described by Socrates in the Phaedrus. In a different work, one speaker describes being taught about how a person can ascend from a “vulgar” form of this concept to a “divine” one via its namesake “ladder” by Diotima. In that work, one speaker satirically claims that this concept is a result of Zeus’s decision to chop in half a former race of humans with two faces and eight limbs.

        "formatted_text": "In an essay that centers on a narrator’s descriptions of James Steerforth’s arm, Martha Nussbaum analyzed this concept in relation to the “moral point of view.” Irving Singer wrote a three-volume work titled for “the nature of” this concept. This concept is likened to a man who “becomes winged” and “looks upward like a bird” when experiencing the fourth form of divine madness described by Socrates in the <em>Phaedrus</em>. In a different work, one speaker describes being taught about how a person can ascend from a “vulgar” form of this concept to a “divine” one via its namesake “ladder” by Diotima. In that work, one speaker satirically claims that this concept is a result of Zeus’s decision to chop in half a former race of humans with two faces and eight limbs. Plato’s <em>Symposium</em> discusses, for 10 points, what concept divided by Greek philosophers into forms such as <em>philia</em>, <em>agape</em> (“ah-GAH-pay”), and <em>eros</em>?",

        "formatted_text": "An instrumental section in this work is in 12/8 time and opens with a rising violin melody from C to A while the basses play a drone on C. An aria for bass in this work features long melismatic phrases on the word “changed” and contains a difficult trumpet solo that is often played today on piccolo trumpet. In one aria in this piece, a soprano declares that even though “worms destroy this body,” “I shall see God.” This work includes an interlude that emulates Italian bagpipers called the “Pifa,” and it also features the arias “The trumpet shall sound” and “I know that my Redeemer liveth.” A chorus sings “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” in a section of this work during which the audience traditionally stands. For 10 points, name this work that contains the “Hallelujah” chorus, an oratorio by George Frideric Handel.",

In Paris, mistreated apprentices in this industry rebelled against their poor living conditions by killing their masters’ cats in the so-called “Great Cat Massacre.” A pioneer of this industry in Venice mass-produced objects called enchiridia (“en-kai-RID-ee-uh”). Benedict Anderson combined the name of this industry with “capitalism” in his book <em>Imagined Communities</em>. This industry was introduced to England by William Caxton. This industry’s “Revolution” started after a goldsmith from Mainz (“MINE-ts”) started using movable type. For 10 points, Johannes Gutenberg was a pioneer of what industry that mass-produces books?",

Important scholars of this task had their writings distributed by disciples known as rawi. According to the hadith, people who are particularly adept at this task have the ability to intercede and bring up to 10 people to heaven.

This country was occupied by British forces during World War II after it was invaded in Operation Fork. The “Match of the Century” between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer was held in this country in 1972. This country submitted to the authority of a foreign king in the “Old Covenant” of 1262. In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan met at a summit in this country’s capital city that eventually resulted in the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Disputes over fishing rights between this country and Britain led to the Cod Wars. This country’s parliament is the oldest in the world, meeting since 930, and is called the Althing.

        "formatted_text": "This musician’s first published instrumental song was a novelty rag called “Rialto Ripples.” A song composed by this musician is the origin of a 32-bar chord progression whose B section consists of seventh chords on scale degrees 3, 6, 2, and 5; that progression is the basis of many songs by other musicians, including “Anthropology” and “Cotton Tail.” This musician wrote a standard that was originally included in, but later removed from, several musicals that he collaborated on, including <em>Rosalie</em>, <em>Strike Up the Band</em>, and <em>Lady, Be Good</em>; that song is “The Man I Love.” A jazz chord progression known as “rhythm changes” derives from this composer’s song “I Got Rhythm.” One of this composer’s songs describes how “the livin’ is easy, the fish are jumpin’” on Catfish Row. For 10 points, name this composer who wrote the song “Summertime” for his opera <em>Porgy and Bess</em>.",

        "formatted_text": "This author wrote a short story that is only six paragraphs long, and which begins with the sentence: “I am losing my interest in human beings; in the significance of their lives and their actions.” One of this author’s protagonists gets into an argument with her father, a former colonel in the Confederate army, over her unwillingness to attend her sister’s wedding. In a story by this author of “The Night Came Slowly,” the protagonist mutters the words “free, free, free!” after hearing that her husband has died in a railroad accident, but then dies of a heart attack when that husband returns alive. This author of “The Story of an Hour” wrote a novella whose protagonist considers having an affair with Robert Lebrun while vacationing on Grand Isle in Louisiana. For 10 points, Edna Pontellier’s identity as a woman rather than just as a wife or mother is kindled in what author’s novella <em>The Awakening</em>?",

In a play by this author, it is revealed that Ann persuaded her father to name the author of <em>The Revolutionist’s Handbook</em> as one of her guardians in a scheme to marry him. That play about the anarchist Jack Tanner includes a third act called “Don Juan in Hell,” which is often performed separately. This author used the Serbo-Bulgarian War as the backdrop for a play in which Raina Petkoff calls Bluntschli her “chocolate-cream soldier.” For 10 points, name this author of <em>Man and Superman</em> and <em>Arms and the Man</em>.",

This book analogizes the word of God to a “double-edged sword” that discerns the intentions of the heart. The Old Testament priest Melchizedek is mentioned multiple times in this text in comparison to Jesus. This book's eleventh chapter speaks of “the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen” in its discussion of faith. This book opens by discussing the superiority of Jesus to the angels. For 10 points, name this anonymous New Testament epistle addressed to the title group of people chosen by God.",

Another algorithm for this task reduces is it to the period-finding problem, which it then solves using a quantum Fourier transform. One algorithm for this task is based on the birthday paradox and iteratively applies a random polynomial until a value is repeated. Numbers for which this task is easy to compute are called “smooth.” This task, which can be performed using a quadratic sieve or Pollard's rho algorithm, can be computed efficiently on a quantum computer with Shor's algorithm. The difficulty of this task provides the security of RSA. Like primality testing, a naive algorithm for this task involves trial division.

One of these events that took place after a famine led the hermit Kamo no Chomei to leave civilization and live in the title <em>Ten-Foot Hut</em> of the book he describes it in. A group of three of these events named for Tokai, Nankai, and Edo that took place in 1854 and 1855 are collectively known as the Ansei. Another of these events led to a pogrom in which 231 Koreans were killed for allegedly causing it. That event left a large Mayan Revival hotel standing. That 1923 event of this type was named for the Japanese region it struck, Kanto, and did not affect Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel. For 10 points, name these events that frequently destroyed buildings in Tokyo without sufficiently strong foundations.",

Presence of the Duffy antigen leads to susceptibility to one form of this disease. Causative agents of this disease reproduce en masse in exoerythrocytic schizogony, forming merozoites. <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> is responsible for much of the transmission of this disease. Tu Youyou won a Nobel Prize for discovering artemisinin's ability to treat this disease. People with sickle-cell trait have increased resistance to this disease in a classic example of heterozygote advantage.

In 1994, David Geffen acquired the third entry in this series from an art museum in Tehran. To explain his choice of media, the artist of this series remarked that “flesh is the reason oil paint was invented.” This series was inspired in part by two Sumerian idols on display at the Met. The paintings in this series were scraped and repainted hundreds of times, and some of them contain mouths cut from cigarette ads. A sketch that was likely a draft for a work in this series was erased by Robert Rauschenberg. An unnumbered painting often grouped with this series is depicted “with bicycle.” The artist's wife Elaine asserted that the figures in this series were not based on her. For 10 points, name this series of abstract female forms by Willem de Kooning.",

Jayne Docherty's book on “Learning Lessons from [this place]” explained why anti-bank robbery tactics such as continuously playing audio of rabbits being murdered did not work on its “value-rational” inhabitants. Inhabitants of this place financed themselves by running a gun shop called “the Mag Bag”. Most of the population at this place were members of a group that split from Victor Houteff and were put on edge by an editorial in the <em>Tribune-Herald</em> titled “The Sinful Messiah.” The leader at this location took several “spiritual wives”, some as young as 12 years old. The 74 people killed at this place in a raid by the FBI was a motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing.

A concerto by this composer uses the allegro, high theme <strong>(read slowly)</strong> “long B B long B G E long E B” to open the <em>Allegro molto appassionato</em> first movement, which is unusually not introduced by an orchestral tutti. This creator of 12 string symphonies claimed that aforementioned theme gave him “no peace.” At age 16, he wrote a piece played by a double quartet; part of that string octet is sometimes used in a symphony he wrote for the birthday of his sister Fanny. For 10 points, name this composer of an E minor violin concerto, also known for the wedding march from his incidental music to <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>.",
