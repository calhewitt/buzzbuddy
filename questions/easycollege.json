One of these objects was formed in the Hadean (“HAY-dee-in”) eon, during which the “Big Splash” may have created its moon.

The eyes of these animals provide a common epithet for Hera, to whom these animals were sacred. The two-headed hound Orthrus died guarding these creatures, which were the object of Heracles’s tenth labor. Hermes tied brushwood to these creatures’ tails to hide their tracks while stealing them from Apollo. After Daedalus built a wooden one of these animals for Pasiphaë (“puh-SIFF-uh-ee”), one of them fathered a monster that was kept in the Labyrinth.

Signals in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum are combined in a method developed by Martin Ryle called aperture synthesis. Astronomers use the “Very Large Array” to study this type of radiation. In 1932, Karl Jansky (“JAN-skee”) first detected emissions in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum from the Milky Way. Supermassive black holes surrounded by accretion disks are known as “quasi-stellar” sources of this radiation. For 10 points, name this form of electromagnetic radiation with the longest wavelength.",

After losing a footrace, a prince of this city named Icarius gave his daughter Penelope to Odysseus in marriage. This city was named for the naiad who married Lacedaemon (“lass-uh-DEE-mun”). Two princes of this city rescued their sister after she was abducted by Pirithous (“py-RITH-oh-us”) and Theseus, and held a rivalry with Idas and Lynceus. This home of Castor and Pollux was ruled by Tyndareus, whose wife gave birth to two eggs after she was seduced by Zeus in the form of a swan. During the Trojan War, this city was led by Menelaus (“men-uh-LAY-us”) by virtue of his marriage. For 10 points, name this Peloponnesian city that was the hometown of Helen.",

Riccardo Drigo edited the original score of this ballet for the 1895 Petipa and Ivanov revival. In an oft-imitated <em>pas de deux</em> (“pah duh doo”) from this ballet, the ballerina performs a series of 32 <em>fouettés</em> (“fway-TAYS”). The protagonist of this ballet breaks the crossbow he received for his twenty-first birthday. In modern productions of this work, the same ballerina plays two roles: one dressed in white, and another in black. At a ball in this ballet, Rothbart introduces his daughter to Prince Siegfried. For 10 points, name this ballet set to music by Tchaikovsky in which Odette is cursed to turn into the title bird.",

During the Battle of Lützen, the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus died during a conflict in this century that was ended by the Peace of Westphalia.

High-intensity X-rays can be generated from these substances in a system called a z-pinch. In these substances, the magnetic field is “frozen in” according to Alfvén’s (“all-VANE’s”) theorem. Various properties of these substances can be measured with a Langmuir (“LANG-myoor”) probe. Magnetohydrodynamics models these substances, which are toroidally confined in tokamaks for fusion. For 10 points, auroras and lightning are examples of what ionized gases considered the “fourth state of matter”?",

Solutions to a differential equation are linearly independent if there is a nonzero value for one of these functions called the Wronskian (“RON-skee-in”). For large inputs, this alternating (*)</strong> multilinear map can be computed using the Laplace expansion theorem, which requires finding cofactors and minors. Eigenvalues are computed by setting this function of the matrix “<em>A</em> minus lambda <em>I</em>” equal to zero and solving for lambda. A matrix <em>A</em> is singular if and only if this function of <em>A</em> is zero. For 10 points, name this quantity often expressed as “<em>ad</em> minus <em>bc</em>” for a two-by-two matrix.",

In that “unequal exchange” episode from Book VI, Diomedes puts his spear away because his ancestor, Oeneus (“EE-nee-us”), was a friend of this character. The legend of Potiphar’s wife mirrors a story in which this figure was falsely accused of rape by the lustful wife of Proitos, (*)</strong> Stheneboea (“sthen-uh-BEE-uh”). This hero’s most famous companion was a brother of Chrysaor (“cry-SAY-or”) who helped him in a quest in which he shoved lead (“led”) down a creature’s throat. Later, this man tried to fly to Olympus, but fell off his mount when he was stung by a gadfly. For 10 points, name this hero who rode Pegasus to slay the Chimera.",

Richard Morris Hunt designed the estates of The Breakers and Biltmore for this family, which was brought to prominence by the founder of the New York Central Railroad, who built a great transport empire.

Members of this ethnicity frequently settled in industrial suburbs like Hamtramck (“ham-TRAM-ick”), Michigan, and Parma, Ohio. A probably-intersex Revolutionary War hero of this ethnicity died leading a cavalry charge at the Battle of (*)</strong> Savannah and names a holiday celebrated mostly in Chicago. Many people of this ethnicity flocked to the United States after the January Uprising. With Irish and Italian-Americans, people of this ethnicity constituted the majority of so-called “white ethnics” who largely switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party in the 1970s.

The 60th sura is titled for an “examined” one of these people. The Qur’an says that these people are to be presided over by <em>qawwamun</em> (“kah-wah-MOON”) because “God has favored some… more than others.” A passage from Sura al-Baqara establishes the custom of reducing by one-half the value of these people’s (*)</strong> testimony. The fourth sura in the Qur’an is named for these people and instructs them to “guard the unseen.” Orthodox Islamic traditions require even adult examples of these people to have guardians when outside the house. For 10 points, give these people who are encouraged by most Islamic traditions to preserve modesty by wearing a hijab.",

A group of enzymes that act on these molecules have designations like ZO, PL-7, and Jo-1 when they appear on a myositis antibody panel. Half of all mitochondrial mutations causing disease are for genes coding these molecules. Pseudouridine is found in the T-psi-C (*)</strong> arm of these molecules, which can also contain inosine near their 5-prime end. These adaptor molecules are charged by synthetases. They have an anticodon loop that can undergo wobble base pairing, and they initially go to the A site. For 10 points, name these cloverleaf-shaped molecules that carry amino acids to the ribosome during translation.",
